In this article, we consider complex systems and introduce the global-local metamodel-assisted stochastic programming via simulation that can efficiently employ the simulation resource to iteratively solve for the optimal first- and second-stage decisions. Specifically, at each visited first-stage decision, we develop a local metamodel to simultaneously solve a set of scenario-based second-stage optimization problems, which also allows us to estimate the optimality gap. Then, we construct a global metamodel accounting for the errors induced by: (1) using a finite number of scenarios to approximate the expected future cost occurring in the planning horizon, (2) second-stage optimality gap, and (3) finite visited first-stage decisions. Assisted by the global-local metamodel, we propose a new simulation optimization approach that can efficiently and iteratively search for the optimal first- and second-stage decisions. Our framework can guarantee the convergence of optimal solution for the discrete two-stage optimization with unknown objective, and the empirical study indicates that it achieves substantial efficiency and accuracy.","tags":["\"dynamic decision-making\"","\"two-stage optimization\"","\"Simulation optimization\"","\"stochastic programming\"","\"Gaussian process metamodel\""],"title":"Global-Local Metamodel-Assisted Stochastic Programming via Simulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hua Zheng","Wei Xie","M.

Each experiment run is often very expensive. To support the optimal and robust process control, we propose a general green simulation assisted policy gradient (GS-PG) framework for both online and offline learning settings. Basically, to address the key limitations of state-of-art reinforcement learning (RL), such as sample inefficiency and low reliability, we create a mixture likelihood ratio based policy gradient estimation that can leverage on the information from historical experiments conducted under different inputs, including process model coefficients and decision policy parameters. Then, to accelerate the learning of optimal and robust policy, we further propose a variance reduction based sample selection method that allows GS-PG to intelligently select and reuse most relevant historical trajectories. The selection rule automatically updates the samples to be reused during the learning of process mechanisms and the search for optimal policy. Our theoretical and empirical studies demonstrate that the proposed framework can perform better than the state-of-art policy gradient approach and accelerate the optimal robust process control for complex stochastic systems under high uncertainty.

METHODS: We modeled glycemia, blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk as health outcomes, using a retrospective cohort of 16,665 patients with type 2 diabetes from New York University Langone Health ambulatory care electronic health records in 2009-2017. We trained an RL prescription algorithm that recommends a treatment regimen optimizing patients' cumulative health outcomes using their individual characteristics and medical history at each encounter. The RL recommendations were evaluated on an independent subset of patients. RESULTS: The single-outcome optimization RL algorithms, RL-glycemia, RL-blood pressure, and RL-CVD, recommended consistent prescriptions as that observed by clinicians in 86.1%, 82.9%, and 98.4% of the encounters, respectively. For patient encounters in which the RL recommendations differed from the clinician prescriptions, significantly fewer encounters showed uncontrolled glycemia (A1c √æinspace8% in 35% of encounters), uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure √æinspace140¬†mmHg in 16% of encounters), and high CVD risk (risk √æinspace20% in 25% of encounters) under RL algorithms compared with those observed under clinicians (43%, 27%, and 31% of encounters, respectively; all p¬†","tags":[],"title":"Personalized Multimorbidity Management for Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Using Reinforcement Learning of Electronic Health Records","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hua Zheng","Wei Xie","Ilya O Ryzhov","Dongming Xie"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623631697,"objectID":"ceb7b52aadfba46c23881dc2fed69210","permalink":"https://zhenghuazx.github.io/hua.zheng/publication/zheng-2021-policy/","publishdate":"2021-06-14T00:48:17.46984Z","relpermalink":"/hua.zheng/publication/zheng-2021-policy/","section":"publication","summary":"Biopharmaceutical manufacturing is a rapidly growing industry with impact in virtually all branches of medicine.

To address these challenges, we propose a green simulation assisted model-based reinforcement learning to support process online learning and guide dynamic decision making.

At any given policy, we predict the expected system response with prediction risk accounting for both inherent stochastic uncertainty and model risk. Then, we propose green simulation assisted reinforcement learning and derive the mixture proposal distribution of decision process and likelihood ratio based metamodel for the policy gradient, which can selectively reuse process trajectory outputs collected from previous experiments to increase the simulation data-efficiency, improve the policy gradient estimation accuracy, and speed up the search for the optimal policy.
